            <li>Pour a glug of Olive Oil in a heated large sauce pan on medium-high.</li>
            <li>Pour in the Carrots and Garlic reducing the heat to medium-low once sizzling. Combine 1 t of Salt and continuously stir and fold the vegetables for 10 minutes or until softened. Do not let them brown. </li>
            <li>Combine Italian Sausage and cook thoroughly for 10 minutes while breaking large chunks of meat.</li>
            <li>Add the Pepper Flakes and generous sprigs of Thyme to the mixture then pour in the Wine and Water. Lower heat to a gentle simmer for 35 - 40 minutes. Add a little more water if the sauce begins to dry.</li>
            <li>While the ragu is cooking, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook the Pasta based on box instructions.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, remove Thyme leaves from the stems for garnish. Measure the desired quantity with your heart.</li>
            <li>Once the ragu is cooked, stir in the Butter and 1 C of Parmesan until melted. Reserve the remainder of the cheese for garnish.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1 C of pasta water. Drain the pasta and combine with the ragu.</li>
            <li>Using your judgment, pour in as much reserved pasta water as needed to moisten the ragu, avoiding a watery mixture.</li>
            <li>Season with Salt and Pepper to taste. Garnish with Thyme, Parmesan Cheese, and/or Pepper Flakes to preferrence.</li>
